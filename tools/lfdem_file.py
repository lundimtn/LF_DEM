def read_snapshot_file(in_file, field_nb=None):
    """
    Purpose:
        Read any LF_DEM file that has a "snapshot" structure, i.e. made of the following:
            a header (x lines starting with #)
            an empty line
            a line starting with #, containing meta-info for a snapshot (strain, strain rate, etc)
            a bunch of lines describing a snapshot
            an empty line
            a line starting with #, containing meta-info for a snapshot (strain, strain rate, etc)
            a bunch of lines describing a snapshot
            ...
        Examples include par_ and int_ files.

    Parameters:
        in_file: the filename, or anything that can be taken as a first argument to pd.read_table
        field_nb: the number of fields (columns) in a snapshot. If not provided, the field nb is guessed from the file name.

    Returning values:
        frames: a list of snapshots
        strains_: the associated strains
        shear_rates_: the associated strain rates
