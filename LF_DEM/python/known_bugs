 - The periodize functions from LF_DEM_posfile_reading module 
   do not take into account the strain so far.
   This is because output files from LF_DEM do not contain this
   information at the moment.
   This bug impacts the pair correlation computation, which is 
   therefore incorrect at the moment.
