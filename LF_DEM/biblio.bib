	abstract = {The resistance functions that relate the forces, couples, and stresslets exerted on ambient fluid by two unequal rigid spheres in low Reynolds number flow are calculated for the case in which the spheres are immersed in an ambient linear flow. In conjuction with earlier works, this paper completes the tabulation of all of the two‐sphere resistance functions at present needed in investigations of the mechanics of suspensions. Each function is calculated first as a series in inverse powers of the center‐to‐center separation, and then, in order to handle the singular behavior caused by lubrication forces, the asymptotic form which the function takes when the spheres are close is combined with the series expansion into a single expression valid for all separations of the spheres.},

	abstract = {A new Stokesian dynamics ({SD}) algorithm for Brownian suspensions is presented. The implementation is based on the recently developed accelerated Stokesian dynamics ({ASD}) simulation method [Sierou and Brady, J. Fluid Mech. 448, 115 (2001)] for non-Brownian particles. As in {ASD}, the many-body long-range hydrodynamic interactions are computed using fast Fourier transforms, and the resistance matrix is inverted iteratively, in order to keep the computational cost O(N log N). A fast method for computing the Brownian forces acting on the particles is applied by splitting them into near- and far-field contributions to avoid the O(N 3 ) computation of the square root of the full resistance matrix. For the near-field part, representing the forces as a sum of pairwise contributions reduces the cost to O(N); and for the far-field part, a Chebyshev polynomial approximation for the inverse of the square root of the mobility matrix results in an O(N 1.25 log N) computational cost. The overall scaling of the method is thus roughly of O(N 1.25 log N) and makes possible the simulation of large systems, which are necessary for studying long-time dynamical properties and/or polydispersity effects in colloidal dispersions. In this work the method is applied to study the rheology of concentrated colloidalsuspensions, and results are compared with conventional {SD}. Also, a faster approximate method is presented and its accuracy discussed.},
